<p class="quality">Quality: 0</p>
<p>Upon use, this item deals 9,999,999 damage to all enemies in the room and then kills you 3 seconds later</p>
<p>This is a single use active item, meaning it is destroyed after using it</p>
<p>Does not kill both phases of multi-phase bosses like Hush or Ultra Greed</p>
<p>If used to kill a boss, the kill still counts as a victory for post-it note completion marks, but the run will still get a game over</p>
<p>Delirium's death animation takes longer than 3 seconds, meaning you will die before it can count as a completion mark. One exception to this is if you are playing as Lazarus or have Lazarus' Rags - you will respawn in the same room and get the kill</p>
<p>Plan C is 5 times rarer than other items in the same item pool, making it less likely to appear</p>

<p>The type of heart consumed to create a clot will give it different abilities: Soul Hearts = More health, Black Hearts = Dark Matter effect, Eternal Hearts = Sacred Heart effect, Gold Hearts = Midas Touch effect, Bone Hearts = Compound Fracture effect, Rotten Hearts = Less health</p>
