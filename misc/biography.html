        <h1>Welcome to OrangeXarot's Website<span id="shh"> ඞ</span></h1>
        <div id="text">
        <p>Well... this is the OrangeXarot's Website, crazy huh?</p>
        <br />
        <p>But who actually is OrangeXarot? a video editor? a graphic designer? a carrot?</p>
        <br />
        <p>No... Well... a Carrot yes but... I'm a 17 year old italian computer geek who is trying a lot of things that can be done with a computer. I will guide you in my surprising adventure, LET'S GO!!</p>
        <br />
        <p>At about 11 years I started playing with batch programs in Windows by doing simple games and I started playing with the Inspects Elements tool to change the HTML of pages</p>
        <br />
        <p>Ever since I was young, I loved watching a genre of videos called YTP (YouTube Poops), growing up I always wanted to create a YTP, in <span id="date">2018</span> I created
        one and I uploaded it on YouTube, honestly it was rather bad but, hey, it was my first one, I kept uploading YTPs and in <span id="date">2021</span> I reached  <a href="https://youtu.be/o6jBLQJmflw" target="_blank">100 subscribers</a> (crazy)</p>
        <br />
        <p>Speaking of YouTube, I spent a lot of time watching videos, over the years I have moved more and more on English videos, I don't know how but in this way I learned English, now I understand it very well and I could probably talk to someone in English by voice</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>In <span id="date">2019</span> I started highschool, guess... yes, Computer Science. There I "learned" HTML, the quotes are because HTML and CSS I had already studied them alone, the same thing actually with Python, now we are doing Java and C</p>
        <br />
        <p>In <span id="date">2020</span> I changed my operating system to Linux, to be precise now I am using Arch Linux, from how you can see from my site I am a Linux fanatic, in fact I will not start talking about Linux otherwise I won't stop</p>
        <br />
        <p>In <span id="date">2021/2022</span> I created several discord bots for my server with my friends, written in JavaScript. Btw I used JavaScript in this site</p>
        <br />
        <p>Obviously having years of experience with Linux I am very practical with the terminal and I also made several scripts for it, for example I created "<a href="https://github.com/OrangeXarot/sups" target="_blank">sups</a>", a script that tells you if there were changes in a site, only because I was waiting for the school to gave us the date to enter the first day</p>
        <br />
        <p>In <span id="date">2022</span> I made a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/themauii/sp1cy-feat-orangexarot" target="_blank">song</a> with TheMAUII, a crazy hit song, the best one you will ever hear in your life... modestly. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>
        <p>And I've also worked with AI making beautiful AI-Art posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/NotXarot" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p>
        <br />
        <p>In <span id="date">2022</span> I created this site, how nice, it's fantastic</p>
        <br />
